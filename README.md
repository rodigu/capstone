## Introduction

Repository for my senior Capstone. Mentored by [Katherine Perry](https://www.soka.edu/about/faculty-staff/katherine-perry), professors of mathematics at Soka University of America.

Written using Typescript with Deno.

This library is a rewrite of my previous code, [network2020](github.com/rodigu/network2020). It was initally written as part of the final project for the Network Science class at Soka University.

## Outline

### Introduction
- background
	- basic intro to network science
	- basic intro to javascript
- reasoning behind doing it
	- learning principles of library making
	- deeper understanding of network science by creating its algorithms from scratch

### Code showcase
- explain some of the algorithms: how they work and what they do
	- BFS
- demonstrate use

### Applications
- show implementations (game, parik?)
- applications
	- boris research
	- social media networks

### Demonstration
- Use real world data
	- take example from textbook and recreate it using the library?
