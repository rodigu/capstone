### Introduction

Repository for my senior Capstone. Mentored by [Katherine Perry](https://www.soka.edu/about/faculty-staff/katherine-perry), professors of mathematics at Soka University of America.

Written using Typescript with Deno.

This library is a rewrite of my previous code, [network2020](github.com/rodigu/network2020). It was initally written as part of the final project for the Network Science class at Soka University.
