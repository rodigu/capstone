## Outline
### Introduction
- background
	- basic intro to network science
	- basic intro to javascript
- reasoning behind doing it
	- learning principles of library making
	- deeper understanding of network science by creating its algorithms from scratch

### Code showcase
- explain some of the algorithms: how they work and what they do
	- BFS
- demonstrate use

### Applications
- show implementations (game, parik?)
- applications
	- boris research
	- social media networks

### Demonstration
